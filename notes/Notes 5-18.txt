Notes:

- Could utilize different penalty methods (currently using quadratic penalty - Section 10.7)
- Interior point method may be overkill since degradation model already takes this into account
- Find database for energy prices and incorporarte. 
- 15.2 (use gaussian processes for future prices)


- Graphs produced by Thursday night
- Model done by Wednesday night
- Writing start by Friday night
